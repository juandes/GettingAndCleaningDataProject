GettingAndCleaningDataProject
=============================

This is the project from the Coursera course, Getting and Cleaning Data.
The project consists on several data sets obtained using an acceloremeter from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The script in the repo merges both the training and test data from the data set into one while creating labels with descriptive
variable names. It also created a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
